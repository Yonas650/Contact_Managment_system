# Contact_Managment_system
The application
stores the contactâ€™s attributes, such as first name, last name, phone number, email 
address, city,
country, and a flag showing whether a contact is among favorite contacts or not. 
The application
will be able to import/export the contacts into a comma separated (CSV) file. The 
user interface allows a user to navigate and perform the tasks/features. Binary 
search tree
(BST) is used as the primary data structure to implement the application.
